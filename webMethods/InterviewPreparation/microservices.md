### **1. What are Microservices?**
**Answer:**
**Microservices** are independently deployable units of logic, each performing a single business function. Applications built using microservices architecture are composed of multiple microservices that work together.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Independence**: Each microservice can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each microservice focuses on a specific business function.
- **Communication**: Microservices communicate via lightweight mechanisms like HTTP or messaging.

**Example:**
- A microservice for user authentication and another for order processing in an e-commerce application.

### **4. What is Integration Server?**
**Answer:**
**Integration Server** is a runtime environment for executing services and facilitating communication between systems. It supports integration of diverse services and ensures secure, efficient execution.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Service Execution**: Invokes services and manages data flow.
- **Security**: Authenticates clients and verifies permissions.
- **Audit Logs**: Maintains logs for monitoring and troubleshooting.

**Example:**
- Using Integration Server to integrate a CRM system with an ERP system.

---

### **5. How is Microservices Runtime Different from Integration Server?**
**Answer:**
**Microservices Runtime** is a superset of Integration Server, optimized for microservices. Key differences include:
- **Lightweight**: Smaller footprint compared to Integration Server.
- **Docker Support**: Designed to run in Docker containers.
- **No OSGi**: Does not use the OSGi platform.
- **Optional Features**: Some Integration Server features are optional in Microservices Runtime.

**Example:**
- Using Microservices Runtime for deploying microservices in a cloud-native environment.

### **6. What is a Circuit Breaker?**
**Answer:**
A **Circuit Breaker** is a design pattern that prevents failures in one part of a system from cascading to other parts. It monitors remote service calls and "trips" (stops requests) if failures exceed a threshold.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Failure Detection**: Monitors for exceptions and timeouts.
- **Circuit States**: Open, Half-Open, Closed.
- **Fallback**: Executes an alternative service if the primary service fails.

**Example:**
- Implementing a circuit breaker to handle failures in a payment processing microservice.

---

### **7. What is Automatic Package Deployment?**
**Answer:**
**Automatic Package Deployment** allows Microservices Runtime to automatically deploy packages from a specified location. It scans for new or updated packages and deploys them without manual intervention.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Hot Deployment**: Ensures minimal downtime during deployment.
- **System Task**: Uses the "Auto Package Deployer" task for scanning and deployment.

**Example:**
- Automatically deploying an updated inventory management package to Microservices Runtime.

---

### **8. What are Configuration Variables Templates?**
**Answer:**
**Configuration Variables Templates** contain configuration properties that can be passed to Microservices Runtime at startup. They allow externalizing configuration for reuse across environments.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Externalization**: Configuration values are set externally.
- **Reusability**: A single Docker image can be used across multiple environments.
- **Environment Variables**: Values can be overridden using environment variables.

**Example:**
- Using a configuration template to set different database credentials for development and production environments.

---

### **9. What is Monitoring in Microservices Runtime?**
**Answer:**
**Monitoring** in Microservices Runtime involves tracking the health and performance of the runtime and its microservices. It provides endpoints for health checks and metrics.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Health Gauge**: Returns the overall status (up/down) of the runtime.
- **Metrics**: Provides server and service metrics in Prometheus format.
- **Endpoints**: `/health` for health checks and `/metrics` for metrics.

**Example:**
- Using the `/health` endpoint to monitor the status of a microservice.

---

### **10. What is Service Monitoring?**
**Answer:**
**Service Monitoring** involves tracking the execution of services in Integration Server. It uses audit logs to provide insights into service performance and errors.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Audit Logs**: Logs data for services, documents, and processes.
- **Log Levels**: Errors only, Errors & Success, Errors-Success & Start.
- **Dashboard**: Provides end-to-end traceability of services and transactions.

**Example:**
- Configuring a service to log data on both success and failure for monitoring.

### **12. Example Scenario: Circuit Breaker**
**Scenario**: Handling failures in a payment processing microservice.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Implement Circuit Breaker**: Add a circuit breaker to the payment service.
2. **Set Thresholds**: Configure the circuit breaker to trip after 5 failures in 10 seconds.
3. **Fallback**: Define a fallback service to handle payments if the primary service fails.
