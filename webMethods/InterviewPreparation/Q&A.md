### **1. What is webMethods Adapter for JDBC?**

**Answer:**
The **webMethods Adapter for JDBC** is an add-on to the webMethods Integration Server that allows seamless and real-time communication with relational databases using a JDBC driver. It enables Integration Server clients to create and run services that perform database operations like retrieving, inserting, and updating data.

**Example:**
If you need to fetch customer details from a MySQL database, you can use the JDBC Adapter to create a service that executes a SQL query and returns the results.

---

### **2. Explain the Architecture Overview of Adapter for JDBC.**

**Answer:**
The **Adapter for JDBC** provides a set of user interfaces (UI), services, and templates to integrate with databases using a JDBC driver. It consists of the following components:

1. **Adapter Connections**: Enable Integration Server to connect to the database at runtime.
2. **Adapter Services**: Allow Integration Server to perform database operations (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE).
3. **Adapter Notifications**: Monitor the database and notify Integration Server when specific actions occur (e.g., a new record is added).

**Example:**
You can configure an adapter connection to connect to an Oracle database, create an adapter service to fetch employee details, and set up an adapter notification to trigger a workflow when a new employee is added.

---

### **3. What are JDBC Drivers?**

**Answer:**
**JDBC Drivers** are required to connect to a relational database using the JDBC Adapter. There are two ways to configure JDBC Drivers:

1. **DataDirect Drivers**: Provided by Software AG. You specify the DataDirect driver in the Data Source Class section of the JDBC Adapter connection.
2. **Custom JDBC Drivers**: Place the database-specific JAR files in the Integration Server directory (`/instances/instance name/WmJDBCAdapter/code/jars`) and specify the Data Source Class.

**Example:**
To connect to a PostgreSQL database, you can either use the DataDirect driver provided by Software AG or place the PostgreSQL JDBC JAR file in the specified directory.

---

### **4. What are the Transaction Types in JDBC Connections?**

**Answer:**
There are three transaction types in JDBC Connections:

1. **NO_TRANSACTION**: No transaction control. Operations are auto-committed.
2. **LOCAL_TRANSACTION**: All operations on the same connection are committed or rolled back together within a transaction boundary.
3. **XA_TRANSACTION**: Supports two-phase commits across multiple databases. All operations on multiple connections are committed or rolled back together.

**Example:**

- Use **NO_TRANSACTION** for read-only operations.
- Use **LOCAL_TRANSACTION** for batch operations where you need to commit or roll back multiple SQL statements together.
- Use **XA_TRANSACTION** for distributed transactions involving multiple databases.

---

### **5. When to Use LOCAL_TRANSACTION?**

**Answer:**
Use **LOCAL_TRANSACTION** when:

- You need to perform batch operations (e.g., multiple INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements).
- You want Integration Server to control when to commit or roll back the transaction.
- You need to ensure that all operations succeed before committing.

**Example:**
If you’re inserting 100 records into a database, use LOCAL_TRANSACTION to ensure that all records are inserted successfully. If one record fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.

---

### **6. When to Use NO_TRANSACTION?**

**Answer:**
Use **NO_TRANSACTION** when:

- You are performing read-only operations (e.g., SELECT queries).
- You don’t need transaction control (e.g., auto-commit is acceptable).

**Example:**
If you’re fetching a list of products from a database, use NO_TRANSACTION since no data modification is involved.

---

### **7. Why Do We Use Boundaries?**

**Answer:**
**Boundaries** are used to explicitly define the start, commit, and rollback points of a transaction. This gives the developer full control over the transaction instead of the adapter.

**Example:**
In a flow service, you can set a boundary to start a transaction, perform multiple database operations, and then commit the transaction only if all operations succeed.

---

### **8. Explain the Order of Events While Using Adapter Service.**

**Answer:**
The steps to use an Adapter Service are:

1. **Create JDBC Adapter Connection**: Configure the connection to the database.
2. **Create Database Table**: Ensure the table exists in the database.
3. **Create and Configure JDBC Adapter Service**: Define the service to perform the required database operation.
4. **Select the Table**: Choose the table to interact with in the Adapter Service.
5. **Provide Inputs and Outputs**: Define the input and output parameters for the service.
6. **Run the Service**: Execute the service to perform the database operation.

**Example:**
To update employee details:

1. Create a JDBC Adapter connection to the HR database.
2. Ensure the `Employees` table exists.
3. Create an Adapter Service to update the `Employees` table.
4. Select the `Employees` table in the service.
5. Provide the employee ID and new details as inputs.
6. Run the service to update the database.

---

### **9. What is the Difference Between NO_TRANSACTION and LOCAL_TRANSACTION?**

**Answer:**

- **NO_TRANSACTION**: No transaction control. Each operation is auto-committed immediately.
- **LOCAL_TRANSACTION**: Provides transaction control. All operations within a transaction boundary are committed or rolled back together.

**Example:**

- Use **NO_TRANSACTION** for reading data (e.g., SELECT queries).
- Use **LOCAL_TRANSACTION** for writing data (e.g., INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) where you need to ensure all operations succeed before committing.

---

### **10. What Happens if a Batch Operation Fails in LOCAL_TRANSACTION?**

**Answer:**
If a batch operation fails in **LOCAL_TRANSACTION**, all changes made within the transaction boundary are rolled back. This ensures data consistency.

**Example:**
If you’re inserting 100 records and the 50th record fails, all 49 previously inserted records are rolled back.

---

### **11. Can Batch Operations Be Configured with NO_TRANSACTION?**

**Answer:**
No, batch operations **cannot** be configured with **NO_TRANSACTION** because each operation is auto-committed immediately. If one operation fails, there’s no way to roll back the previous operations.

**Example:**
If you’re inserting 100 records with NO_TRANSACTION and the 50th record fails, the first 49 records are already committed, leading to data inconsistency.

---

### **12. What Are the Advantages of Using XA_TRANSACTION?**

**Answer:**
**XA_TRANSACTION** supports distributed transactions across multiple databases. It ensures that all operations across different databases are committed or rolled back together.

**Example:**
If you’re updating records in both an Oracle database and a MySQL database, XA_TRANSACTION ensures that both updates are committed only if both succeed. If one fails, both are rolled back.

---

### **13. What Are the Key Considerations When Using JDBC Adapter?**

**Answer:**

- Ensure the correct JDBC driver is configured.
- Use appropriate transaction types based on the operation (read vs. write).
- Optimize database queries for performance.
- Handle errors and exceptions gracefully.

**Example:**
When fetching large datasets, use pagination to avoid performance issues.

---

### **1. Explain the Order of Events While Using Adapter Notifications.**

**Answer:**
Adapter Notifications are used to monitor database changes and trigger workflows in webMethods. Here’s the order of events:

1. **Create Adapter Notification**: Use the JDBC Adapter connection to create a notification.
2. **Publishable Document**: A new publishable document is automatically created in the same folder.
3. **Polling Notification**: A new polling notification is created in the IS Admin Console.
4. **Enable Polling Notification**: Enable the polling notification in the IS Console.
5. **Buffer Table & Trigger**: A buffer table and trigger are created in the database.
6. **Publishing Flow Service**: Create a flow service to modify the database table.
7. **Subscribing Service**: Create a subscribing service to handle the notification.
8. **Trigger in Designer**: Create a trigger in Designer using the publishable document and subscriber.

**Flow of Events:**

- When the publishing service modifies the database table, the database trigger is activated.
- The buffer table is updated, and the publishable document is modified.
- The Integration Server trigger notifies the subscriber, which then processes the changes.

**Example:**
If a new order is added to the `Orders` table, the database trigger updates the buffer table, and the subscriber service sends a confirmation email to the customer.

---

### **2. What is the Difference Between Custom SQL and Dynamic SQL?**

**Answer:**

- **Custom SQL**: The SQL query is fixed at design time. Input variables are provided at design time.
- **Dynamic SQL**: The SQL query is not fixed and can be constructed dynamically at runtime.

**Key Differences:**

- **Custom SQL**: Faster because it is pre-compiled. Used when the SQL query is static.
- **Dynamic SQL**: More versatile because the query can change at runtime. Used when the SQL query needs to be dynamic.

**Example:**

- **Custom SQL**: `SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = :DeptName` (fixed query).
- **Dynamic SQL**: A query constructed at runtime based on user input, e.g., `SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'Sales' AND Age > 30`.

---

### **3. What is a Stored Procedure?**

**Answer:**
A **stored procedure** is a precompiled SQL code stored in the database. It can be reused and executed multiple times. Stored procedures can accept parameters and perform complex database operations.

**Uses:**

- Data validation.
- Access control.
- Centralizing business logic in the database.

**Example:**
A stored procedure `GetEmployeeDetails` can be created to fetch employee details based on an employee ID.

---

### **4. What is a Stored Procedure with Signature Service?**

**Answer:**
A **StoredProcedureWithSignature** service automatically introspects the stored procedure’s parameters at design time. This eliminates the need to manually specify parameters.

**Advantages:**

- Parameters are automatically detected.
- Parameters can be changed at runtime.

**Example:**
If a stored procedure `UpdateSalary` has parameters `EmployeeID` and `NewSalary`, the StoredProcedureWithSignature service will automatically detect these parameters.

---

### **5. What is a Stored Procedure Without Signature Service?**

**Answer:**
A **StoredProcedureWithoutSignature** service requires manual specification of parameters at design time. Parameters cannot be changed at runtime.

**Example:**
For the same `UpdateSalary` stored procedure, you must manually specify `EmployeeID` and `NewSalary` as input parameters in the adapter service.

---

### **6. Explain Built-in Transaction Management Services.**

**Answer:**
Built-in transaction management services in webMethods allow you to define explicit transaction boundaries in flow services. These services are part of the `WMArt` package.

**Key Services:**

1. **startTransaction**: Starts a new transaction.
2. **commitTransaction**: Commits the transaction.
3. **rollbackTransaction**: Rolls back the transaction.

**Example:**

```plaintext
1. startTransaction
2. Perform database operations (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE).
3. If all operations succeed, commitTransaction.
4. If any operation fails, rollbackTransaction.
```

**Use Case:**
When performing multiple database operations in a single flow service, use transaction management to ensure all operations are committed or rolled back together.

---

### **7. How Do You Use Built-in Transaction Management Services?**

**Answer:**

1. **Start a Transaction**: Use `startTransaction` to begin a transaction.
2. **Perform Operations**: Execute database operations within the transaction boundary.
3. **Commit or Rollback**: Use `commitTransaction` to save changes or `rollbackTransaction` to undo changes if an error occurs.

**Example:**

```plaintext
1. startTransaction
2. Insert a new record into the `Orders` table.
3. Update the `Inventory` table.
4. If both operations succeed, commitTransaction.
5. If any operation fails, rollbackTransaction.
```

---

### **8. What Are the Advantages of Using Stored Procedures?**

**Answer:**

- **Reusability**: The same code can be executed multiple times.
- **Performance**: Stored procedures are precompiled, reducing execution time.
- **Security**: Access control can be implemented at the database level.
- **Centralization**: Business logic is centralized in the database.

**Example:**
A stored procedure `CalculateBonus` can be used to calculate employee bonuses based on performance metrics.

---

### **9. What Are the Limitations of Stored Procedures in webMethods?**

**Answer:**

- **Array/Struct Parameters**: Stored procedures with array or struct as OUT parameters are not supported.
- **MySQL Functions**: Stored procedure services do not support MySQL functions.

**Example:**
If a stored procedure returns an array, it cannot be used directly in webMethods.

---

### **10. When to Use Stored Procedures vs. Custom/Dynamic SQL?**

**Answer:**

- **Stored Procedures**: Use for complex, reusable database operations.
- **Custom SQL**: Use for simple, fixed queries.
- **Dynamic SQL**: Use for queries that need to be constructed dynamically at runtime.

**Example:**

- Use a stored procedure to calculate taxes.
- Use Custom SQL to fetch a list of products.
- Use Dynamic SQL to construct a search query based on user input.

---

### **11. What Are the Key Considerations When Using Adapter Notifications?**

**Answer:**

- Ensure the buffer table and trigger are correctly configured in the database.
- Use polling notifications for real-time monitoring.
- Handle errors and exceptions in the subscribing service.

**Example:**
If the buffer table is not updated correctly, the notification may not trigger the subscriber service.

---

### **12. What Are the Performance Implications of Dynamic SQL?**

**Answer:**

- **Dynamic SQL** is slower than **Custom SQL** because it is compiled at runtime.
- Use Dynamic SQL only when necessary to avoid performance bottlenecks.

**Example:**
If you need to construct a query based on user input, use Dynamic SQL. For fixed queries, use Custom SQL.

---

### **1. Explain Implicit and Explicit Transactions.**

**Answer:**

- **Implicit Transactions**: These are automatically managed by the Integration Server transaction manager. No explicit boundaries are defined. The transaction starts and ends automatically based on the adapter configuration (NO, LOCAL, or XA Transaction without boundaries).
- **Explicit Transactions**: These are manually defined by the developer using built-in services from the `WmART` package. Boundaries are explicitly set to define where the transaction starts, commits, and ends. Explicit transactions can only be configured with LOCAL or XA Transaction with boundaries.

**Example:**

- **Implicit Transaction**: When using NO_TRANSACTION, each SQL statement is auto-committed without any manual control.
- **Explicit Transaction**: Use `startTransaction`, `commitTransaction`, and `rollbackTransaction` services to control the transaction boundaries in a flow service.

---

### **2. How Does Class Loading Work in webMethods?**

**Answer:**
Class loading in webMethods determines how and when Java classes (e.g., JDBC drivers) are loaded into the Integration Server. The location where you place the JAR files affects their availability and scope.

### **7. Example Scenario: Using WmART Transaction Services**

**Scenario**: You need to perform multiple database operations in a single transaction.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Start Transaction**:

   - Use `startTransaction` to begin the transaction.

2. **Perform Operations**:

   - Insert a record into the `Orders` table.
   - Update the `Inventory` table.

3. **Commit or Rollback**:
   - If both operations succeed, use `commitTransaction`.
   - If any operation fails, use `rollbackTransaction`.

**Flow Service Example**:

```plaintext
1. startTransaction
2. Insert into Orders
3. Update Inventory
4. If successful, commitTransaction
5. If failed, rollbackTransaction
```

### **1. What is the Function of the Interval Column in Polling Notifications?**

**Answer:**
The **Interval Column** in Polling Notifications defines the time interval at which the polling notification monitors changes in a specified database table. It determines how frequently the adapter checks the database for new or updated records.

**Example:**
If the interval is set to **5 minutes**, the adapter will check the database table every 5 minutes for changes. If a new record is added, the adapter triggers the associated workflow.

---

### **2. Explain the Runtime Behavior of Connection Pools.**

**Answer:**
Connection pools manage database connections efficiently by reusing existing connections instead of creating new ones for each request. Here’s how they work at runtime:

#### **Steps in Runtime Behavior:**

1. **Initialization**:

   - When a connection is enabled, Integration Server initializes the connection pool.
   - It creates the number of connections specified in the **Minimum Pool Size** field.

2. **Providing Connections**:

   - When an adapter service requests a connection, Integration Server provides one from the pool.
   - If no connections are available and the **Maximum Pool Size** is not reached, the server creates new connections (based on the **Pool Increment Size**) and adds them to the pool.

3. **Handling Full Pools**:

   - If the pool is full (reaches the **Maximum Pool Size**), the requesting service waits for a connection to become available.
   - The wait time is determined by the **Block Timeout** field.

4. **Removing Inactive Connections**:
   - Periodically, Integration Server inspects the pool and removes inactive connections that exceed the **Expire Timeout**.

**Example:**

- **Minimum Pool Size**: 5 connections.
- **Maximum Pool Size**: 20 connections.
- **Pool Increment Size**: 2 connections.
- **Block Timeout**: 30 seconds.
- **Expire Timeout**: 10 minutes.

If 5 connections are in use and a 6th request comes in, Integration Server creates 2 new connections (total = 7). If the pool reaches 20 connections, new requests wait up to 30 seconds for a connection to become available. Inactive connections are removed after 10 minutes.

---

### **3. Explain Package Dependencies in JDBC Adapters.**

**Answer:**
Package dependencies ensure that Integration Server loads or reloads packages in the correct order during startup. This is crucial for proper functioning of adapter connections and services.

#### **Key Points:**

1. **Dependency Hierarchy**:

   - A user-defined package using resources from the **WmJDBCAdapter** package must have a dependency on the **WmJDBCAdapter** package.
   - The **WmJDBCAdapter** package depends on the **WmART** package.

2. **Connection and Service Packages**:

   - If connections and adapter services are defined in different packages:
     - The package containing connections must depend on the adapter package.
     - Packages containing adapter services must depend on the associated connection package.

3. **Best Practices**:

   - Keep connections for different adapters in separate packages to avoid interdependencies.
   - If a package contains connections for multiple adapters, reloading one adapter package will reload all connections.

4. **Enabling and Disabling Packages**:
   - Integration Server will not enable a package if its dependent packages are disabled.
   - You can disable a package even if other enabled packages depend on it. However, you must manually disable dependent packages first.

**Example:**

- **User Package**: Depends on **WmJDBCAdapter**.
- **WmJDBCAdapter**: Depends on **WmART**.
- **Connection Package**: Contains JDBC connections and depends on **WmJDBCAdapter**.
- **Service Package**: Contains adapter services and depends on the **Connection Package**.

If you disable **WmJDBCAdapter**, you must first disable the **User Package** and **Service Package**.

---

### **4. Example Scenario: Package Dependencies**

**Scenario**: You have a user-defined package `MyApp` that uses JDBC Adapter services.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Define Dependencies**:

   - `MyApp` depends on `WmJDBCAdapter`.
   - `WmJDBCAdapter` depends on `WmART`.

2. **Create Connection Package**:

   - Create a package `JDBC_Connections` to store JDBC connections.
   - `JDBC_Connections` depends on `WmJDBCAdapter`.

3. **Create Service Package**:

   - Create a package `JDBC_Services` to store adapter services.
   - `JDBC_Services` depends on `JDBC_Connections`.

4. **Enable Packages**:

   - Enable `WmART`, `WmJDBCAdapter`, `JDBC_Connections`, and `JDBC_Services` in the correct order.

5. **Disable Packages**:
   - To disable `WmJDBCAdapter`, first disable `JDBC_Services` and `JDBC_Connections`.

---

### **5. Example Scenario: Connection Pool Behavior**

**Scenario**: You have a JDBC Adapter connection pool with the following configuration:

- **Minimum Pool Size**: 5
- **Maximum Pool Size**: 20
- **Pool Increment Size**: 2
- **Block Timeout**: 30 seconds
- **Expire Timeout**: 10 minutes

#### **Runtime Behavior:**

1. **Initialization**:

   - Integration Server creates 5 connections when the connection is enabled.

2. **Request Handling**:

   - If 5 requests come in, all 5 connections are used.
   - If a 6th request comes in, Integration Server creates 2 new connections (total = 7).

3. **Full Pool**:

   - If the pool reaches 20 connections, new requests wait up to 30 seconds for a connection to become available.

4. **Inactive Connections**:
   - If a connection is inactive for 10 minutes, Integration Server removes it from the pool.

---

### **6. Example Scenario: Polling Notifications**

**Scenario**: You want to monitor a `Orders` table for new records every 10 minutes.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Configure Polling Notification**:

   - Set the **Interval Column** to 10 minutes.
   - Specify the `Orders` table to monitor.

2. **Trigger Workflow**:
   - When a new record is added to the `Orders` table, the polling notification triggers a workflow to process the order.

### **1. What are Users and Groups in webMethods?**

**Answer:**
In webMethods, **Users** and **Groups** are used to manage access to Integration Server resources. Users are individual accounts, while Groups are collections of users with shared privileges.

#### **Key Components:**

1. **Username**:

   - A unique identifier for a user (e.g., `JDSmith` for John D. Smith or `MktgPurchAgent` for a marketing purchase agent).

2. **Password**:

   - A secret string used for authentication. Passwords are hashed for security.

3. **Group Membership**:
   - Users are assigned to groups to control access to resources. Access is granted or denied at the group level.

**Example:**

- Create a user `Alice` and assign her to the `Developers` group to allow her to create and modify services in Software AG Designer.

---

### **2. What are the Predefined Groups in webMethods?**

**Answer:**
webMethods provides predefined groups with specific privileges:

1. **Administrators**:

   - Users in this group can configure and manage the Integration Server using the Administrator console.

2. **Developers**:

   - Users in this group can create, modify, and delete services using Software AG Designer.

3. **Replicators**:
   - Users in this group can replicate packages and configurations across Integration Servers.

**Example:**

- Add a user to the `Administrators` group to grant them full control over the Integration Server.

---

### **3. How Do Users, Groups, and ACLs Work Together?**

**Answer:**

1. **Create a User**:

   - Define a username and password.

2. **Create a Group**:

   - Define a group name and add users to it.

3. **Create an ACL**:

   - Define an Access Control List (ACL) and add the group to it.

4. **Assign ACL Permissions**:
   - Control access to resources (e.g., services, folders) by assigning the ACL to them.

**Example:**

- Create a user `Bob`.
- Create a group `Marketing`.
- Add `Bob` to the `Marketing` group.
- Create an ACL `Marketing_ACL` and add the `Marketing` group to it.
- Assign `Marketing_ACL` to a service to allow `Bob` to execute it.

---

### **4. What are ACLs (Access Control Lists)?**

**Answer:**
**ACLs** control access to resources (e.g., services, folders) at the group level. They define:

- **Allowed Groups**: Groups that can access the resource.
- **Denied Groups**: Groups that cannot access the resource.

**Example:**

- Assign an ACL to a service to allow the `Developers` group to execute it but deny access to the `Guests` group.

---

### **5. What are the Different Kinds of Access in ACLs?**

**Answer:**
There are four types of access:

1. **List**:

   - Controls whether a user can see the existence of an element and its metadata.

2. **Read**:

   - Controls whether a user can view the source code and metadata of an element.

3. **Write**:

   - Controls whether a user can update, lock, rename, delete, or assign an ACL to an element.

4. **Execute**:
   - Controls whether a user can execute a service or web service descriptor.

**Example:**

- Grant `Read` and `Execute` access to the `Developers` group for a service to allow them to view and run it.

---

### **6. What is ACL Inheritance?**

**Answer:**
**ACL Inheritance** allows subfolders and services to inherit the ACL of their parent folder. If a subfolder or service does not have an assigned ACL, it inherits the ACL of the parent folder.

**Example:**

- Assign an ACL to a folder. All subfolders and services within it will inherit the ACL unless they have their own ACL.

---

### **7. What is the Difference Between "When Top-Level Service Only" and "Always" in ACL Enforcement?**

**Answer:**

- **When Top-Level Service Only**:

  - Integration Server checks the ACL only when the service is directly invoked by a client.

- **Always**:
  - Integration Server checks the ACL every time the service is invoked, whether by a client or another service.

**Example:**

- If `OrderParts` is invoked by a client and two other services, setting `Always` will enforce ACL checking for all three invocations.

---

### **8. How Do ACLs and Locking Work Together?**

**Answer:**

- **Locking** controls access at the individual user level.
- **ACLs** control access at the group level.

**Rules:**

- To lock an element, you must have `Write` access to it.
- To edit ACL permissions, you must lock the element (except for packages and folders).

**Example:**

- Lock a service to prevent other users from modifying it while you edit its ACL.

---

### **9. How Do ACLs Affect Running and Debugging Services?**

**Answer:**

- **Running Services**:

  - You need `Execute`, `Read`, and `List` access to step through a top-level service and all its child services.

- **Debugging Services**:
  - You need `Read` access to debug a service by sending an XML file or setting a breakpoint.

**Example:**

- If you lack `Read` access to a child service, Designer will "step over" it during debugging.

---

### **10. Example Scenario: Managing Users, Groups, and ACLs**

**Scenario**: You want to allow the `Marketing` team to execute a service but restrict access to the `Finance` team.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Create Users**:

   - Create users `Alice` and `Bob`.

2. **Create Groups**:

   - Create groups `Marketing` and `Finance`.

3. **Assign Users to Groups**:

   - Add `Alice` to `Marketing` and `Bob` to `Finance`.

4. **Create ACL**:

   - Create an ACL `Marketing_ACL` and add the `Marketing` group to the `Allowed Groups`.

5. **Assign ACL to Service**:
   - Assign `Marketing_ACL` to the service.

**Result**:

- `Alice` can execute the service, but `Bob` cannot.

---

### **11. Example Scenario: ACL Inheritance**

**Scenario**: You want all services in a folder to inherit the ACL of the parent folder.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Assign ACL to Folder**:

   - Assign `Marketing_ACL` to the parent folder.

2. **Verify Inheritance**:
   - Check that subfolders and services display "inherited" next to their ACLs.

**Result**:

- All subfolders and services inherit `Marketing_ACL` unless they have their own ACL.
