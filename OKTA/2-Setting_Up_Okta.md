### Step 1: **Setting Up Okta - The Basics**

To understand and work with Okta, let’s start with its **setup process**. We’ll begin with the essentials: creating an Okta account, setting up users, and connecting an application.

### **1. Create an Okta Account**

#### **Why?**

To start using Okta, you need a tenant (an isolated Okta environment) to manage users, applications, and security policies.

#### **Steps to Set Up:**

1. **Go to Okta Developer Site:**

   - Visit [https://developer.okta.com/](https://developer.okta.com/).

2. **Sign Up for an Account:**

   - Click **"Sign Up"** and provide details:
     - Your name, email, and password.
     - Your organization name (e.g., "TechCorp").
     - Choose your country.
   - Okta will create a tenant for you (e.g., `techcorp.okta.com`).

3. **Confirm Email:**
   - Verify your email to activate the account.

#### **What Happens Next?**

- You now have access to the **Okta Admin Console** to manage users, applications, and settings.

### **2. Add Users to Okta**

#### **Why?**

You need to define who will use your system—these are your users. Each user has a profile containing details like name, email, roles, and permissions.

#### **Steps to Add Users:**

1. **Log in to the Admin Console:**

   - URL: `https://<your-tenant>.okta.com/admin`.

2. **Navigate to Directory → People:**

   - This is where you manage users.

3. **Add a User:**
   - Click **Add Person**.
   - Fill in the user details:
     - First Name, Last Name.
     - Email (used for login and notifications).
     - Username (can be the same as email).
   - Assign a temporary password or let Okta send a welcome email to the user.

#### **Real-Time Example:**

- You add an employee named Jane Doe with the email `jane.doe@techcorp.com`.
- Jane receives a welcome email with a link to set her password and log in.

### **3. Configure Applications in Okta**

#### **Why?**

Applications are the tools your users need to access, such as Gmail, Salesforce, or custom-built APIs. Okta manages user authentication for these apps.

#### **Steps to Add an Application:**

1. **Navigate to Applications → Applications:**

   - This is where you connect external apps to Okta.

2. **Add an Application:**

   - Click **Create App Integration**.
   - Choose the type of app:
     - **OIDC - OpenID Connect**: For most modern apps.
     - **SAML 2.0**: For apps using SSO.

3. **Configure App Details:**

   - Provide the app’s name (e.g., "Gmail").
   - Add the **Redirect URI**:
     - This is the URL where the app redirects after login.
     - Example: `https://mail.google.com/auth`.

4. **Assign Users to the App:**
   - Add the user or group (e.g., "Marketing Team") that needs access to the app.

#### **Real-Time Example:**

- You configure Gmail as an app in Okta.
- Assign Jane Doe to this app.
- Jane can now log in to Okta and click the Gmail icon to access her email without entering credentials again (SSO).

---

### **4. Test the Setup**

#### **Why?**

To ensure everything works as expected, verify the user login process and app access.

#### **Steps to Test:**

1. **Log in as a User:**

   - Visit `https://<your-tenant>.okta.com`.
   - Enter Jane Doe’s credentials (email and password).

2. **Access the Dashboard:**

   - After login, Jane sees the Okta dashboard with the Gmail icon.

3. **Try SSO:**
   - Jane clicks the Gmail icon.
   - Okta authenticates her and redirects her to Gmail, logged in automatically.

### **5. Real-World Analogy**

- **Okta Tenant**: Think of this as a company’s headquarters.
- **Users**: The employees working in the company.
- **Applications**: Tools (e.g., computers, email accounts) employees use to perform their jobs.
- **SSO (Single Sign-On)**: Employees swipe their ID card at one door (Okta login) and can now access all tools they need (apps) without swiping again.

---

### **Next Steps:**

We’ve set up the basics:

1. Created an Okta account.
2. Added users.
3. Integrated an application.
4. Tested the setup.
