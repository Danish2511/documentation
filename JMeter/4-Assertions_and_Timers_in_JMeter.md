# **Assertions and Timers in JMeter**

## **Concepts:**

1. **What are Assertions in JMeter?**
   - **Assertions** are used to validate the response from a server to ensure it meets specific criteria. They help verify that the server returns the correct data (e.g., status code, response text, etc.).
   - Common types of assertions:
     - **Response Assertion**: Validates the response data based on various conditions like text, size, and response code.
     - **Duration Assertion**: Ensures the response time is within a specified range.
     - **Size Assertion**: Verifies the size of the response is within the expected range.
     - **XML Assertion**: Validates the response against an XML structure.
     - **JSON Assertion**: Validates the response for correct JSON formatting.
2. **What are Timers in JMeter?**
   - **Timers** are used to simulate the delay between requests, making the test more realistic. Without timers, JMeter will send requests as fast as possible.
   - Common types of timers:
     - **Constant Timer**: Adds a fixed delay between requests.
     - **Gaussian Random Timer**: Adds a random delay, with a bell curve distribution, to simulate more realistic user behavior.
     - **Uniform Random Timer**: Adds a random delay within a specific range.

## **Hands-On Exercise:**

**Step 1: Adding Assertions**

1. Open your existing **Test Plan**.
2. Right-click on one of your **HTTP Request Samplers** and select **Add → Assertions → Response Assertion**.
3. **Configure the Response Assertion:**
   - **Field to Test**: Choose `Response Text`.
   - **Pattern Matching Rules**: Set it to `Contains`.
   - **Patterns to Test**: Enter a keyword that should appear in the response, such as `Welcome` (useful for validating if the page content is correct).
4. **Add a Duration Assertion** to the same HTTP Request Sampler to ensure that the response time is under a certain threshold:
   - Right-click the sampler → **Add → Assertions → Duration Assertion**.
   - Set the **Duration** to `2000` (this will fail the test if the response time exceeds 2 seconds).
5. **Optional:** Add a **Size Assertion** to validate the response size:
   - Right-click the sampler → **Add → Assertions → Size Assertion**.
   - Set the **Minimum** size to `1000` (in bytes) to check if the response is large enough.

**Step 2: Adding Timers**

1. Right-click on the **Thread Group** and select **Add → Timer → Constant Timer**.

   - Set the **Thread Delay (in milliseconds)** to `1000` (this will add a 1-second delay between each request).

2. **Optional**: Add a **Uniform Random Timer** to simulate varied user behavior:
   - Right-click on the **Thread Group** → **Add → Timer → Uniform Random Timer**.
   - Set the **Random Delay Maximum** to `2000` (adds a random delay between 0 and 2 seconds between requests).

**Step 3: Running the Test**

1. **Run the Test:**

   - Click the **Start** button (green arrow).
   - Review the responses in the **View Results Tree** listener.
   - Look at the **Assertions Results**:
     - **Response Assertion**: If the expected text is not found in the response, the test will fail.
     - **Duration Assertion**: If the response time exceeds 2 seconds, the test will fail.
     - **Size Assertion**: If the response size is below 1000 bytes, the test will fail.

2. **Check the Timers:**
   - Ensure there is a delay between requests, as defined by the **Constant Timer** or **Uniform Random Timer**.

## **Task:**

1. **Run Your Test with Assertions and Timers:**

   - Add multiple assertions to validate the responses for each HTTP request.
   - Add timers to simulate realistic delays between requests.
   - Run the test and observe the results.

2. **Modify Timers for Different Behavior:**
   - Experiment with different types of timers (e.g., Gaussian Random Timer) to see how they affect the response times and behavior.

## **Summary:**

Today, you learned:

- The purpose and types of **Assertions** in JMeter and how to use them to validate responses.
- How to add **Response Assertions**, **Duration Assertions**, and **Size Assertions** to check various conditions.
- The role of **Timers** in simulating real user behavior by adding delays between requests.
- You ran tests with assertions to validate the correctness of responses and timers to make the test more realistic.
