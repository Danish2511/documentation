# Overview of Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform primarily used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It handles large volumes of data in a fault-tolerant and scalable manner. Kafka was originally developed by LinkedIn and later open-sourced through the Apache Software Foundation.

## Use Cases for Kafka

Kafka is widely used for:

- **Real-time data streaming**: Collecting and delivering real-time analytics.
- **Event sourcing**: Capturing and replaying events in a system.
- **Log aggregation**: Storing logs from distributed systems.
- **Data integration**: Connecting different data sources.

## Key Concepts in Kafka

- **Producer**: A producer sends (publishes) messages to Kafka topics. Producers can send data asynchronously or synchronously.
- **Consumer**: A consumer reads (subscribes to) messages from Kafka topics.
- **Broker**: A Kafka broker is a server that stores and serves messages. Kafka brokers handle all read and write requests.
- **Topic**: A topic is a category or feed name to which records are sent by producers.
- **Partition**: A topic is split into multiple partitions for scalability and performance.
- **Offset**: Each message within a partition is assigned a unique ID called an offset.
- **Zookeeper**: Kafka uses Zookeeper to manage cluster metadata.

## Kafka Ecosystem Components

- **Kafka Connect**: Used for integrating Kafka with external systems (databases, storage, etc.).
- **Kafka Streams**: A client library for processing and analyzing data stored in Kafka.
- **Schema Registry**: Manages schemas for the data stored in Kafka, ensuring compatibility between producers and consumers.
