Great! Let's begin with **Day 1: Introduction to Apigee and API Management**.

### **Day 1: What is Apigee and Why API Management?**

---

#### **1. What is Apigee?**

Apigee is Google Cloud’s API management platform. It allows you to design, secure, and scale APIs while exposing backend services to consumers in a controlled and monitored manner.

---

#### **2. Why API Management?**

- **Security:** Protect your APIs from unauthorized access with OAuth, API keys, and more.
- **Scalability:** Handle millions of requests per second efficiently.
- **Analytics:** Gain insights into API performance and usage trends.
- **Monetization:** Charge for API usage if needed.
- **Developer Enablement:** Provide a portal for developers to discover, access, and test APIs.

---

#### **3. Key Features of Apigee**

- **API Proxies:** Add a facade over backend services to standardize and secure APIs.
- **Policies:** Apply logic like caching, quotas, or transformations with minimal coding.
- **Developer Portals:** Allow API consumers to register, test, and use APIs.
- **Analytics:** Track performance, errors, and traffic in real-time.

#### **Real-World Example**

Let’s say you own an e-commerce business. You want to provide your services (catalog, cart, and payments) to third-party apps. Exposing these services through APIs allows app developers to integrate your business features. Apigee helps you secure and monitor these APIs while enabling third-party access seamlessly.
