# Apigee Step-by-Step Guide

## Day 1: Introduction to Apigee and API Management

### Topics Covered:
- **What is Apigee?**
- Importance of API Management
- Key Features of Apigee
- Apigee’s Role in Modern API Ecosystems

### Concept Explanation:
1. **What is Apigee?**  
   Apigee is a platform for developing and managing APIs. It helps organizations expose backend services securely, efficiently, and at scale. Apigee’s primary purpose is to mediate between backend services and API consumers, ensuring security, performance, and reliability.

2. **Importance of API Management:**
   API management involves creating, publishing, and managing APIs. Key benefits include:
   - Security enforcement
   - Monitoring and analytics
   - Versioning and lifecycle management
   - Traffic control (rate limiting, quotas)

3. **Key Features of Apigee:**
   - API Proxies
   - Security (OAuth, API Keys, etc.)
   - Policies (e.g., rate limiting, caching)
   - Analytics
   - Developer portal

4. **Role in Modern API Ecosystems:**
   Apigee supports microservices, mobile applications, and cloud-native architectures by acting as a gateway between APIs and consumers.

### Real-World Example:
An e-commerce company uses Apigee to expose its catalog, order, and user services via APIs. Apigee ensures only authenticated users access APIs, limits excessive traffic, and monitors usage.

### Hands-On Exercise:
1. Sign up for an Apigee trial account at [Apigee Edge](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/).
2. Familiarize yourself with the Apigee interface.
3. Explore documentation to identify where key features (e.g., Proxies, Analytics) are located.

## Day 2: Understanding Apigee Architecture

### Topics Covered:
- Apigee Components
- API Proxy Workflow
- Edge Architecture Overview

### Concept Explanation:
1. **Apigee Components:**
   - **API Proxies:** Act as intermediaries between clients and backend services.
   - **Policies:** Predefined logic (e.g., caching, authentication) applied to API traffic.
   - **Developer Portal:** Enables developers to explore, register, and use APIs.
   - **Analytics:** Provides insights into API usage.

2. **API Proxy Workflow:**
   - A client sends a request to an API proxy.
   - Apigee processes the request via policies.
   - The request is forwarded to the backend.
   - The backend response is processed and returned to the client.

3. **Edge Architecture Overview:**
   Apigee’s architecture includes:
   - **Management Plane:** Used for designing, deploying, and monitoring APIs.
   - **Runtime Plane:** Handles API traffic.

### Real-World Example:
A weather application’s API proxy ensures requests to the weather service are authenticated and cached to reduce backend load.

### Hands-On Exercise:
1. Draw a diagram of the Apigee architecture components.
2. Identify real-world services in your domain that could benefit from an API gateway.

## Day 3: Creating Your First API Proxy

### Topics Covered:
- What is an API Proxy?
- Creating a Reverse Proxy
- Deploying and Testing Proxies

### Concept Explanation:
1. **What is an API Proxy?**
   An API Proxy is a facade for backend services. It abstracts service implementation details from API consumers.

2. **Creating a Reverse Proxy:**
   Reverse proxies expose backend services via Apigee, adding security, analytics, and policies.

### Hands-On Exercise:
1. Navigate to Apigee’s API Proxies section.
2. Create a new proxy using the "Reverse Proxy" template.
3. Configure the target endpoint to point to a public REST API (e.g., https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).
4. Deploy the proxy and test it via Postman or curl.

## Day 4: Working with Policies

### Topics Covered:
- What are Policies?
- Common Policies: Caching, Quotas, and Transformations

### Concept Explanation:
1. **What are Policies?**
   Policies are reusable logic components applied to API traffic.

2. **Common Policies:**
   - **Caching:** Improves performance by storing responses.
   - **Quotas:** Limits the number of API calls per client.
   - **Transformations:** Modifies request or response payloads.

### Hands-On Exercise:
1. Add a "Response Cache" policy to your API Proxy.
2. Test the caching behavior by sending multiple requests.

## Day 5: Advanced Topics

### Topics Covered:
- Flow Variables
- Shared Flows
- Securing APIs with OAuth and API Keys

### Concept Explanation:
1. **Flow Variables:**
   Flow variables store and retrieve data during API processing (e.g., `request.queryparam.name`).

2. **Shared Flows:**
   Reusable logic shared across multiple proxies.

3. **Security:**
   - **OAuth:** Issues access tokens for secure access.
   - **API Keys:** Validates client access.

### Hands-On Exercise:
1. Create a shared flow for logging requests.
2. Integrate it into multiple proxies.
3. Configure OAuth for an API proxy.

## Day 6: Analytics and Monitoring

### Topics Covered:
- Exploring Analytics
- Monitoring API Traffic
- Setting Alerts

### Hands-On Exercise:
1. Explore Apigee’s analytics dashboard.
2. Create reports to analyze traffic patterns.
3. Set up alerts for high latency or error rates.

## Day 7: Integration with Backend Services

### Topics Covered:
- Connecting to REST and SOAP Services
- Using Service Callouts
- Error Handling

### Hands-On Exercise:
1. Configure a proxy to call a SOAP backend service.
2. Add error handling policies to manage failures gracefully.

---

## Final Project:
Build a complete API Proxy for a mock e-commerce platform. Include:
- Authentication (OAuth or API Keys)
- Caching and rate limiting
- Custom transformations
- Analytics and monitoring setup
- Integration with a sample backend
